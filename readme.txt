Enables anyone to highlight your page: auto-generates a tinyURL (to your site), that can be emailed/shared with ANYONE on ANY SOCIAL NETWORK & more..

== Description ==

**Makes Your Web-Site/Blog VERY VIRAL!**

Add a highlighter pen to your blog: anyone can then make 'highlights on any part of your page' and **easily post** them to any Social Networking & Bookmarking site (Facebook, Twitter, LinkdIn, Digg, etc.) Each post auto includes a **tiny URL** linking other readers back to your highlighted page.)

1. **No Signup** needed by anyone.
1. **No Download** needed by anyone.
1. **FREE** (and fast!) NO FINE PRINT.

[Highlight as you surf](http://roohit.com/site/1click.php) and directly post highlights to your website. **Ever blogged about something you read online? Shared a link? Or, linked to another webpage?** Now automatically embed/quote a part of that page - easily. No need to "join", or pay, NO FINE PRINT :)

Totally customize the look/feel. Very, very COOL


**To Try it:**

1. [On this page itself](http://go.rooh.it), or on any other webpage, simply *type rooh.it/ before the URL* address (e.g. [rooh.it/google.com](http://rooh.it/google.com '')) and your mouse cursor instantly changes into a highlighter pen. We recommend you [add a button](http://roohit.com/site/1click.php 'Hassle free') so that you won't have to type each time you want to highlight.
1. Select any text and watch it instantly get *highlighted* in color! 
    - Mouseover any highlight to post it to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn or *any social network* - along with a customizable auto-generated tinyURL - for others to link back to the same *highlighted page.* (Yes, it **works instantly for everyone!** Try it!)
